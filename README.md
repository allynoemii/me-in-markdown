## introduction

My name is Allyson Mendoza Escobar and I am in 10th grade. My favorite book at the moment is My heart and other black holes by Jasmine Warger. I like this book because it mentions serious topics and also the story was very intruiging from the start. My favorite movie is Incredibles 2 and Frozen because they were my childhood favorites and the plot in both of the movies were interesting. I like Frozen because the very first song in the beginning of the movie was amazing. 

Some new skills I learned was how to crochet. Some personal achievments of mine are ???? Fun facts about myself are that I can read, write, and somewhat talk in Korean. My goals for this school year is to not procrastinate and to pass at least one of my AP classes. Most of my summer, I visit family, take trips to san diego, and go to disneyland.
